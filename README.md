# VBA-challenge

Two solutions were found online and are included as notes inside the script file
First was a solution to automate conditional formatting, and the code was retrieved and modified from (https://www.automateexcel.com/vba/conditional-formatting/)
The second was a solution to formatting as percentage, as the one in my notes refused to work (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42844778/vba-for-each-cell-in-range-format-as-percentage)
